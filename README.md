GPC Emulator


GPC is a custom 8 bit instruction set I created for a small processor to gain a deeper inside about the workings of a CPU and it's surrounding component. I am planing to upload schematics of the CPU, am planning to create as well as files for FPGAs to try out programs on hardware as well.

This the Emulator to spped up software development + test out new features I want to add to Instruction set before commiting to hardware.
This project is only for research and educational purposes no guarentess given.
